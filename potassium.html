        <p> Potassium is a little tricky to remember on the periodic table because the symbol is "K".</p>
        <p>The K represents the word Kalium. It is an older term used to describe the element and has its origins in the word "alkali."</p>
        <p>Potassium is a member of the alkali group with sodium and cesium.</p>
        
        <P>Did your mom ever to tell you to eat bananas because they're good for you? It was probably all of the potassium that made her say that. Potassium is an important element found in many foods.</P>
